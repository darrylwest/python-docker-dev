# Python Development

## Bugs

* [ ] osx build: tar uses the incorrect user/group when creating the tar file.  need to force it to 1000:1000 to match user
* [ ] should install bpython with pip to get the correct version
* [ ] change .motd banner to python 3.11 (correct version)
* [x] add .ssh/known_hosts to home/dpw/
